1. There is a code of automation of finding minimization of a given dnf expression to a regular minimized expression using Quine McCluskey method
These method can input up to 4 types of variables (a, b, c, d)
The input is:
2
a & b | -a & b | a & -b

2. There is a code of automation of finding the dnf of a function, also up to 4 variables(still working on bugs)
I also added -> sign in boolean algebra as "r", so you can use it
The input is:
2
a r b
